<p><em><h2>Welcome! My name is Jake, I am currently studying IT digital skills at EKC Dover College. Before I joined the college, I studied IT - in the digital world at Dover ChristChurch Academy. My hobbies are computing, gaming, cooking/baking and walking. In my spare time I go on walks, bake cakes and sometimes volunteer in charity events such as Macmillan. While I was at the charity event, I assisted in setting up everything like tables, bunting, balloons and the tombola activity. My main part was making the drinks for everyone that wanted one and baking the cakes.
